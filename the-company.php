						<p>We have been open for over 3 years and adopted CES Touch just after we opened. It is really simple and easy to use and allows us to process orders in seconds. We do everything on Touch; from deposits to gift vouchers to processing orders directly to the kitchen. We would be lost without it as it is so hassle free. We love it.

						<p>9 years ago we introduced CES Touch to Jin Kichi and we use Touch to process orders via tablets. This allows us to quickly and efficiently process orders. It saves us so much time as orders can be directly to the appropriate kitchen; whether it’s the sushi kitchen or hot kitchen. We wouldn’t go back.

						<p>With Touch we have not experienced many issues but if we have, CES has provided a great customer service. It’s never broken down on us and it is so easy to use. The all in one software helps with almost any task we throw at it. With the integrated chip & PIN and contactless payments, it helps provide a quicker transaction time.

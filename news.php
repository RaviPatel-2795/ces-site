						<p>The integration was launched at the end of 2017 and has been a huge success with well over 1000 live terminals out in the field. We now receive daily requests to add the Payment Sense module for both new and existing customers.
						<br>
						<br>
						There are two types of integration available for Payment Sense:
						</p>
						<ul class="dealernews">
							<li>Pay at Counter (known as PaC) 
							</li>
							<li>Pay at Table (known as PaT)
							</li>
						</ul>
						</br>
						<p>The Pay at Counter integration is very flexible and allows a single terminal to be used by multiple tills, therefore two tills can share a single payment terminal. Or alternatively a till can be set up to be able to use multiple payment terminals (up to 4) so if you had three tills sharing two payment terminals when processing card payments you can select which payment terminal you want to use for that transaction.
						</p>
						</br>
						<p>Pay at Table is designed for use in restaurant environments and will hugely improve efficiency when taking payments at table. Fully itemised bills can be printed on the payment terminals with additional options to split bills and add gratuity and the table will automatically close on the POS  saving waiters two visits to the till.
